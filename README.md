<p>I'm passionate about software design/implementation quality/performance.</p>
   
<p>I'm passionate about state of the art software development tools.</p>
   
<p>I am focused, work hard, stay productive, and challenge myself.</p>
   
<p>My strong combination of design vision/taste plus technical implementation/debugging skills are what sets me apart.</p>
   
<p>I am skilled at the process of creatively enumerating alternatives, weighing pros/cons, and identifying the overall best solution.</p>
   
<p>I thrive on problems with high essential complexity.</p>

<p>I like to work with and/or mentor people who learn quickly.</p>

<p>I am honest with myself, seek truth, and prefer to face reality as it is.</p>
   
<p>I am perpetually proud of my current work, while also embarassed about code I wrote 5 years ago.</p>
   
<p>I compete with my former self while collaborating with others.</p>
