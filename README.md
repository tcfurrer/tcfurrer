I'm a software architect and engineer, currently working in Java.
I'm passionate about software design+implementation quality and performance.
I'm passionate about state of the art software development tools.
I work hard, stay productive, and challenge myself.
My strong combination of design vision/taste plus technical implementation/debugging skills are what sets me apart.
I like to work with or mentor quick learning people.
I am an autodidactic life-long learner with multiple interests
   (software development, technological progress, genetics, human healthcare/medicine,
    astronomy and astrophysics, mechananical engineering, psychology, space exploration,
    microscopy, music, art, biology, woodworking, etc).
I am honest with myself, seek true knowledge, and strive to always face reality as it is.
I am perpetually proud of my current work, yet embarassed about code I wrote 5 years ago.
I compete with my former self while collaborating with others.
I believe strongly in the importance and value of free software.
I love Java and want to continue working with it on technically challenging projects.
